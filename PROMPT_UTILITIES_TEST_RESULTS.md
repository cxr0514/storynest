## Test Results

### 1. YAML-Formatted Illustration Prompt
The `generateIllustrationPrompt()` function creates structured YAML metadata:

```yaml
---
prompt_type: character_illustration
character:
  name: Luna
  species: Dragon
  traits:
    - purple scales
    - silver belly
    - tiny wings
scene:
  location: Enchanted Forest waterfall cave
  action: Flying up toward glowing runes
style:
  art_type: children's book illustration
  quality: high quality, detailed
  mood: magical, enchanting
---

Create a children's book illustration featuring Luna the Dragon with purple scales, silver belly, tiny wings. The scene shows Luna Flying up toward glowing runes in Enchanted Forest waterfall cave. Style should be magical and enchanting, perfect for a children's storybook.
```

### 2. Cleaned Prompt for Claude
The `cleanForClaude()` function removes YAML metadata for direct use:

```
Create a children's book illustration featuring Luna the Dragon with purple scales, silver belly, tiny wings. The scene shows Luna Flying up toward glowing runes in Enchanted Forest waterfall cave. Style should be magical and enchanting, perfect for a children's storybook.
```

### 3. Character Memory System
The `buildCharacterMemory()` function maintains character consistency:

```
You are continuing a story or image involving this consistent character:

Character Profile:
- Name: Luna
- Species: Dragon
- Traits:
  - purple scales
  - silver belly
  - tiny wings

Additional Notes:
- Luna is the main character. Her wings should appear small and delicate, almost fairy-like. Her purple scales should have an iridescent quality.

Always match visual and narrative traits. Do not improvise new features.
