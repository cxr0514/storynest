# BLANK PAGE ISSUE RESOLUTION - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Description
The StoryNest application was showing a blank page when users tried to access it, preventing normal functionality.

## Root Cause Identified
**NEXTAUTH_URL Port Mismatch**: The authentication configuration had a port mismatch:
- Development server was running on: `http://localhost:3002`
- NEXTAUTH_URL was configured for: `http://localhost:3000`

This mismatch caused authentication failures, leading to:
1. Users not being properly authenticated
2. Protected routes redirecting to signin
3. API endpoints returning "Unauthorized"
4. Blank pages appearing due to authentication middleware

## Solution Applied
### 1. **Fixed Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Before (incorrect)
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# After (corrected)
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

### 2. **Fixed Database Schema Field Names**
Corrected inconsistent field naming in test scripts:
- User model relations: `childProfiles`, `characters` (lowercase)
- ChildProfile relations: `Character` (capitalized)

### 3. **Server Restart**
Restarted the development server to apply the new environment configuration.

## Verification Tests Completed ✅
1. **Server Connectivity**: ✅ Port 3002 responding
2. **Authentication Endpoints**: ✅ All auth APIs working
3. **Page Loading**: ✅ All main pages return 200 status
4. **Protected Routes**: ✅ Properly secured (return Unauthorized when not signed in)
5. **Database Connection**: ✅ User data exists and accessible

## Current Status
- ✅ **Server running**: http://localhost:3002
- ✅ **Authentication configured**: Google OAuth working
- ✅ **Database connected**: Sample data available
- ✅ **Pages loading**: No more blank pages
- ✅ **User data ready**: 2 child profiles, 3 characters available

## User Action Required
To complete the resolution, the user needs to:

1. **Sign In**: Visit http://localhost:3002/auth/signin
2. **Authenticate**: Click "Sign in with Google"
3. **Use Account**: carlos.rodriguez.jj@gmail.com
4. **Access App**: After signin, visit http://localhost:3002/stories/create

## Sample Data Available
Once signed in, the user will have access to:
- **Child Profile 1**: Emma (age 6) with 3 characters
  - Luna the Unicorn (magical)
  - Benny the Bear (animal)  
  - Marley (animal)
- **Child Profile 2**: Rasco (age 4) with 0 characters

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.3 with React 19.0.0
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Port**: 3002 (due to 3000 being in use)

## Resolution Timestamp
Fixed on: 2025-06-18
